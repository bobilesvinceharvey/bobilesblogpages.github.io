        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <img src="https://www.clarkson.edu/sites/default/files/2023-06/Software-Engineering-Hero-1600x900.jpg" alt="software engineering">
        <p>As a computer science student, I have always been fascinated by the power of code and how it shapes the digital world we all are already a part of. Having said that, I am one of the thousands of people who dream of becoming a Software Engineer. Thinking about it now, it feels scary and the closer I am to graduating the more intimidating reality becomes especially since I know that this is a highly competitive field. Time flies, and it is only a matter of time until we face our hardest test yet, looking for a job.</p>

        <h2>Why Software Engineering?</h2>
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u/0/d/15h5QtFyzS0iC08cRCg1Y3UE7qkAD0LCf" alt="Software Engineering">
        <p>To be honest, I never thought of becoming one since what I really wanted to be was to become a doctor. I was exposed to computers for the first time when I was in first grade. We were taught how to use microsoft word one by one and I enjoyed it a lot but I never thought that what I would be studying in college is computer science. Now, I am not the best at coding but I really enjoy writing in a language that a computer can understand. From websites, appplication, to games. There are limitless possibilities for every people that knows how to code. The only question that always lingered in my mind is, <strong><i>what should I create?</i></strong></p>
        <p>The probability of us, of the exact you or I to be born is 1 in 400 trillion. Humans used to carve onto the walls of caves their own hands, humans created languages to communicate, built the pyramids, sculpt marble, made paintings, what for? To shout, scream into the future that "I am here.", "I was once here.", "This is what I was thnking.", "This is what I was feeling.", and like every human being, I also want to be remembered. I want to create something that I can be remembered for. And through software engineering, I hope, no, I am certain that one day I can create something that screams who I am, that I was once here, of how much it was of a miracle for me to be alive.</p>

        <h2>Where I currently am</h2>
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*aPfdrf5Y14OzFUXgEwB9TA.jpeg" alt="Current Skills">
        <p>My current skills are laughable, and honestly pathetic. I can code, I know the syntax, but compared to the people who are on the same level, I really do need to work harder, practice more, ask more, study more, and most importantly, code more.</p>
        <p>Currently, I know how to code in Python, Java, SQL, and C++. But I am currently more familiar with C++ since it is the latest language we needed to study. I also know how to write HTML albeit having a long way to go.</p>
        <p>I know within myself that I may know the basics of these languages, and maybe some complex parts of them, but I still have a lot to learn and improve on if I really want to become a software engineer. One of the problems I have is that having too much going on with my life right now, I find it hard to find time to practice coding consistently. And because of that, I am not confident about my current skills. When I face complex problems, I find it really hard to remember or find ways to fix a bug or a logical problem within my code. I need a whole lot of practice before I graduate and I worry that I am losing time.</p>

        <h2>Plans and Goals</h2>
        <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E12AQGC9FK_3YusYQ/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1589389400871?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Lr9jeai1YG7oEamn7ZIjUVKchiZpkk_A5zXsK3jdVjs" alt="plans">
        <p>My main goal is to become a software engineer. I plan to improve my coding skills by practicing consistently, taking on more complex projects, and re-learning my previous programming languages. I also want to gain experience in software development through more personal projects. I am determined and have to be even more determined to keep learning and growing in this field. Some of the plans I currently have in mind are what follows.</p>

        <h3>Plans:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Practice coding for at least an hour every day.</li>
            <li>Think of problems I currently have and make projects out of them to show interviewers that I can fix problems and do actual work.</li>
            <li>Network with professionals or even fellow students in the industry to learn from their experiences and gain insights into the field.</li>
            <li>Fix my sleeping schedule.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Become proficient in at least two programming languages.
                <ul>
                    <li>Re-learn Python or Java.</li>
                    <li>Improve my skills in C++.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Build a portfolio of projects that showcase my skills and experience of at least 5 personal projects.</li>
            <li>Secure an internship or entry-level position in software development within six months of graduation.</li>
            <li>Train how I speak to make sure I get to relay what I really want to say and avoid misunderstandings especially in work interviews.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The number of lines in my code might be little, but it is still increasing. I know that in every challenge I may face, I will never be alone because I have God in front of me, and my family by my side. I know there will be hardships and doubts I will face but I will always remember that if my heart wants it enough, no matter how hopeless things might become, my heart will create hope through the things that I believe in. All I have to do is fight off my cowardice and self-doubt, and continue down this path no matter what, even if all that is left in me is perseverance, I should and must walk forward.</p>
