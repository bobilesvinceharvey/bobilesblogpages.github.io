        <p>In the short time that I've been living, I can say that video games have given me experience and lessons that would have taken me several lifetimes to learn if I were to live my life in reality alone. From the time I was a kid, I was always drawn to the various worlds I get to travel that have provided me with countless hours of entertainment, escape, and even personal growth. Through gaming, I've been a traveller, an adventurer, a detective, a doctor, a magician, an agent, a soldier, and many more through playing characters in video games that were at first just a way to vent unwanted feeling out and have fun, without knowing it will change who I am and who I will be forever. </p>

        <h2>Why gaming matters so much to me</h2>
        <div class="leaguepic">

        </div>
        <p>In every game that I played, there was a lesson to learn, people to talk to, mysteries to uncover, and places to travel. There were so much to have fun with and every curiosity is rewarded and imagination had no limits. In many ways, gaming has become more than a hobby for me, especially during the times that was overwhelming and lonely. Games was a world I can choose to get into or out of whenever I want to. I get to experience different lives and different stories if I want to take a break from my real one. Ultimately, it saved not only me, but a lot of people around the world. And being part of such a community gives a kind of joy that will always be important to fellow gamers like me.  </p>

        <h2>Values I learned</h2>
        <div class="chesspic">

        </div>
        <p>Gaming taught me valuable life lessons like problem-solving, patience, and etc. but the lesson planted deepest in my heart is perseverance. Losing in a game is not the end, you get to keep trying and trying until you eventually succeed. Some games are really challenging and requires you to think outside the box, and most of the time with harder games I was not able to solve things at the first try. But losing in a game never felt like the end to me, all it did was keep on pushing me to try again, improve, and grow from where I was. These experiences carry on to the real world and shaped how I actually solve my problems and face challenges. Games remind me that problems are part of the progress that I must walk through to eventually make my dreams a reality.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Gaming is not a simple entertainment. It is a source of inspiration, growth, and purpose for me, and most probably to fellow gamers all over the world. Gaming is already a part of who we are, a part of our identity. Some people will never understand what I mean, and some people will laugh at us for taking these fantasy worlds so seriously, but this is why gaming is so important to so many of us. <strong><i>"No Game No Life"</i></strong>, sounds absurd when you were never into games all your life, but we understand it so well, too well. <strong><i>Because these games are the lives we lived.</i></strong></p>
