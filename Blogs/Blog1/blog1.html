        <p>Like the old adage that says, <strong><i>"There is no such thing as a free lunch."</i></strong>, there must be something that we give up to be online as well. In this age of fast growing technology, being online is already a necessity. From the social media applications we use to online banking, from e-learning to remote work, it is already quite obvious that the internet has become an integral part of our everyday lives. However, this convenience comes at a cost. <strong>Have you ever wondered what exactly is it that we must pay to have all these benefits, things that make our lives easier?</strong></p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center">Privacy</h2>

        <div class="text-content">
          <p>One of the most significant costs of being online is the loss of privacy. Every click, every search, and every interaction with digital platforms is tracked and stored. Companies use this data to tailor advertisements and improve their services, but it also means that personal information is shared with third parties. Data collected today are stored for an indefinite period of time and can be used later on for purposes that we may not even be aware of or consented to. Someething that we may think was used for personalization can be turned into something we never agreed to that can be terrible, terrible things. This can lead to identity theft, targeted scams, and a weird feeling of being watched.</p>
        <p> I remember talking to my friends about wishing to buy a piano, and next thing that happened was a lot of advertisement about piano and keyboards started to show up in every social media app that I use. From Facebook, Instagram, X, and even Tiktok showed options of what to buy. That is when I started to wonder, can these applications access my phone's microphone? Can it access anything else? Such happenings make me worry, paranoid even, so we must be careful of what data we allow these companies to have and as much as possible remove their access and permisions from the settings of our devices no matter how minimal the control we have over these data in reality. </p>

        <p>Often subtle at first but is one of the most "expensive" part of us that we may give up to be chronically online. People spend unhealthy hours everyday, scrolling through social media applications that demand long hours of attention from people. Being online and engaging with online content for hours exposes us to a continuous stream of dopamine that fries our brain over a long period of time that we almost never notice. Both men and women lose confidence and experience lower levels of self-esteem everyday because of "instagram perfect" people that they see on these applications, comparing themselves to these people constantly, every single day.</p>
        <p>Not only that, the mental costs of being chronically online goes beyond self-esteem. It distorts reality and our real life expectations. The online world rewards the extremes, perfection, outrage, and drama because they are the contents that hold the attention of people longer. Engaging with these types of content affects our brain to feel bored about what should have been "normal". My life was better when there were no online world that I was part of. I was more confident, I had less friends but I was happier. Things that would have made me a lot happy feel like lukewarm water now. This is not a coincidence, this is the result of being online for a really long time. And I believe that is the same reason why everybody is sad and lonely in this generation, always in search for "more", anything more than what they are.  I never wondered why suicidal ideation and depression is a problem so prevalent today, because this is another price to pay. </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center">Convenience or Security?</h2>
        <p>Being online is a double-edged sword. Yes it offers a lot of convenience especially here in this fast-paced world we currently live in, but it also comes with significant costs that I want to remind everyone to take care of before it becomes something we have to give an important part of ourselves up for. Privacy and Mental Health is just a few of the things we give up for our online lives. As we continue to walk and navigate through this digital world, it is important to be smart and make conscious choices about how we interact or engage with technology.</p>
