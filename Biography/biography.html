       <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; font-family: Tahoma; text-indent: 36px;">
        I am <b>Vince Harvey Bobiles</b> born at Labo, Camarines Norte<sup>1</sup>.
        My Birthday is on the 14th of November in the year 2004<sup>2</sup>.
        According to stories my parents tell people all the time, 
        we used to live in an apartment in which it was so small that it wasn't really 
        comfortable for a family to live in, we were in poverty<sup>3</sup>.
        My father worked all types of jobs while my mother stayed home to take care of me<sup>4</sup>.
        <strong>As a child, I was said to be a really kind and smiley little kid</strong><sup>5</sup>.
        When my brother was born we transferred houses and they said that 
        <em>if they needed me to take a diaper from the bedroom even when I was 
        scared of how dark the room was, I'd slowly crawl to get the diapers 
        and used to run back fast as I was really scared of ghosts, but I always 
        took the diapers for my little brother anyway</em><sup>6</sup>.
        We left that house we rented as well since the owner had other plans for it, 
        we went to Laguna and that is where we were raised for most of our childhood<sup>7</sup>.
        A few years later when I became 4 years old, I had to start going to school<sup>8</sup>.
        That very first day I remember getting nervous all over about what was to come to me 
        but my father carried me in his arms while my mother walked with us on the way<sup>9</sup>.
        It was a rainy day, and it was perfect<sup>10</sup>.
        I always got first place in my class and I was a child my parents could be proud 
        of for most of my kindergarten and elementary years<sup>11</sup>.
        But it was a reality that we were poor and hardly got by and my mother was often sick as well, 
        so my father decided to work overseas<sup>12</sup>.
        I clearly remember the 3:00AM dark morning that before he left 
        he rounded us and led a prayer before he left<sup>13</sup>.
        <i><b>In my childhood, I always wanted to become a doctor since my mother was always sick </b></i>
        and always said that I would be the one to help her get better, that 
        was all I dreamed about being<sup>14</sup>.
        We were so poor that I used to say to my mother, 
        "Ah yung pang mayaman na ulam?", everytime she tells us that what we were gonna
         have for dinner was a can of sardines<sup>15</sup>.
        I was young but I understood what was happening, 
        that we were going through something and that was most likely the best we could buy, 
        while I do not remember what was going on inside my head, I think I just wanted to 
        cheer her up, she was sick and was still raising us alone<sup>16</sup>.
        Aside from that, I had a lot of fun back in my childhood, I used to play a lot outside 
        and get dirty all over all the time<sup>17</sup>.
        Me, and 3 of my friends were the most feared 
        kids in patintero, batong-bola, and the likes to the point that they made a 
        rule that the four of us can not be teammates anymore since we were just 
        dominating the other group because we were too fast on our feet<sup>18</sup>.
        Life was fun then, I thought everything will always stay the same<sup>19</sup>.
        I thought all my friends at that time were going to be my friends for life<sup>20</sup>.
        Time passed and we graduated elementary school, I graduated as the valedictorian 
        and delivered a long boring speech at the graduation ceremony<sup>21</sup>.
        Me and my classmates promised that we were going to the same high school together 
        since we can't take being separated<sup>22</sup>.
        But life has other plans, 
        we did not know that the school we were in was not registered, 
        so all the high schools we went to enroll into were not accepting us, 
        we had to find some fix somehow so that we do not have to go back from 
        grade 6 to grade 1 again<sup>23</sup>.
        I passed the exam in my first attempt validating 
        my capabilities that really I was a grade 6 student, unfortunately the 
        others had a bit of a hard time<sup>24</sup>.
        It was sad but we had to be separated<sup>25</sup>.
        They went into a school that will accept them as grade 7 temporarily until 
        they can also pass but I already enrolled into the agreed public school<sup>26</sup>.

        <b>In my teenage years</b>, specifically when I was around 13 or 12 in grade 7, it was a bit challenging to make friends<sup>1</sup>.
        I was all alone in a foreign place and I felt like everyone was already friends with each other even before I came, especially since I was a late enrollee<sup>2</sup>.
        I had a hard time understanding integers, sets, and everything at the start because I was not able to listen to the lectures<sup>3</sup>.
        But despite all that, I was able to go through that as well<sup>4</sup>.
        I noticed that in every exam, there was this kid who has nearly as high as the scores I get and in my mind I was competing with him<sup>5</sup>.
        So in every exam, I started asking him about how much he got, how well he did, and etc. to the point that we became friends<sup>6</sup>.
        I was able to make a friend<sup>7</sup>!
        And from him, I was able to make two more<sup>8</sup>!
        And they were the friends I probably needed then<sup>9</sup>.
        My best friend, Leonard, one of the three friends I made and the one I was competing with, taught me how to play mobile games like Geometry Dash and Mobile Legends<sup>10</sup>.
        We had the same birthday, and I was really having fun when the four of us were together<sup>11</sup>.
        The best memories I had in this period was when every after class, the whole class would go into the plaza to practice a festival dance and because the plaza was more often than not full of people, we opted to go into the back of a catholic church there, we practiced for a lot of time and I was really proud of our class, we performed and we took home a certificate which is now unknown to me who took it home actually<sup>12</sup>.
        After that, I finished grade 7 as its only achiever, and began to be full of myself<sup>13</sup>.
        I did not even go into the recognition to get my medal, even when my class adviser reminded me to go<sup>14</sup>.
        I think she got mad at me because when I tried to greet her one time when I saw her in the hallway, she did not even look at me<sup>15</sup>.
        Then, I became a grade 8 student but our little group broke into two<sup>16</sup>.
        Leonard and I were able to go into a higher section, and the two girls in our group were not, I really missed them<sup>17</sup>.
        I became a totally different kid, a totally different person<sup>18</sup>.
        This is also the period where I learned how to talk trash, of how to use all these foul words against another person and learned what it meant<sup>19</sup>.
        In this period of time, I used to have only 20 pesos to get me through the day<sup>20</sup>.
        What I used to buy all the time was either champorado or turon that can be bought inside the campus, either one was only 10 pesos<sup>21</sup>.
        I used to keep the other 10 pesos and save it back at home in my part of the cabinet beneath my folded clothes<sup>22</sup>.
        That was enough to make me full anyway<sup>23</sup>.
        I just lived normally for the rest of my high school life, and continued to pass my classes<sup>24</sup>.
        But one time, there was this quarter in grade 9 that I was not able to be part of the honor roll, that is when it hit me, that I had become a disappointment<sup>25</sup>.
        I continued to be part of the honor roll for the rest of my junior high school years, but that part hit me hard, that I wasn't the same kid anymore, that I became too addicted to the games on my phone<sup>26</sup>.
        But my gaming addiction actually became worse in grade 10 since that was when COVID-19 hit the Philippines and that was the time we were forced to use online alternatives for our classes<sup>27</sup>.
        Still, despite that I was able to finish as part of the honor roll, thanks to an unexpected friend I made in grade 9 that continued to help me every single time, she's the closest friend I've ever had until now in the present<sup>28</sup>.
        When I became a senior high school student, I enrolled into the University of the East<sup>29</sup>.
        Our life was slowly getting better<sup>30</sup>.
        My parents were able to create their own business and it began to do well<sup>31</sup>.
        In the latter half of this year, we were finally allowed to have face to face classes, but it became another challenge in my life<sup>32</sup>.
        For the first time ever, I would have to live far away from my parents<sup>33</sup>.
        I graduated high school with honors in the University of the East<sup>34</sup>.

        Finally, I have to decide what university I would want to attend and what course I want to study<sup>1</sup>.
        I no longer wanted to be a doctor at this point since if that is what I will aim to do, and make my mother wait for me to work on her, that will take too much time and I want her to be well already, immediately now, and not in the future, I wanted to fight her sickness now and not for her to wait for me to become one who can<sup>2</sup>.
        My best friend that I was able to make from senior high school and I planned to take the same course and go into the same university<sup>3</sup>.
        Since we had fun at an earlier immersion class we took when we were in SHS, in computer engineering, that was what we agreed to take<sup>4</sup>.
        I inquired about another school and planned to enroll there but my friend was not allowed by his parents to go to that school so what we did was think of another course<sup>5</sup>.
        My parents talked to me to just take Mechanical Engineering and I was able to convince him to take that as well<sup>6</sup>.
        Seeing as everything was finally decided, <b>I enrolled into the University of the East as a Mechanical Engineering student</b>, but he suddenly had a change of heart and enrolled as a Computer Science student instead<sup>7</sup>.
        He said that it was because his parents told him that he can not survive engineering and he was completely convinced after that<sup>8</sup>.
        For the second time, I was left behind by a friend thinking that I would go into the same school with them<sup>9</sup>.
        But I understood his reason, and did not become mad<sup>10</sup>.
        I also made friends with a lot of people in BSME, I experienced a lot of things there that made me think why exactly I was there<sup>11</sup>.
        It taught me a lot of life lessons<sup>12</sup>.
        I was still full of myself that I could continue my excellence just like in the past, I did not review a lot, I just opened the power points the night before an exam like I do every time<sup>13</sup>.
        <b><i>But this time, it did not work</i></b><sup>14</sup>.
        <b><i>I passed every subject but Calculus</i></b><sup>15</sup>.
        That is when it hit me that this subject was seriously gonna have some effort from me<sup>16</sup>.
        I was already panicking and thinking of how much I wanna shift, of how much I regret picking BSME, I was having a crisis inside, asking questions like, "am I really as great as I think I am?"<sup>17</sup>.
        But I did not give up, I enrolled in the class again, with the same professor and challenged it again, this time I had some kind of fire inside me and I was able to pass<sup>18</sup>.
        My professor saw my improvement and was really proud of me, and in my whole life, that was something I think I can be proud of that I failed<sup>19</sup>.
        Despite him failing me once, despite that being a forever stain on my permanent record, I feel an overwhelming gratitude for him for teaching me what life is<sup>20</sup>.
        I am never going to hate him for that especially since that was entirely my fault, this is something I am proud of that I was able to make someone like him who used to terrorize classes for his strictness, proud of me<sup>21</sup>.
        <b><i>That failure taught me perseverance, resilience, and a lot more</i></b><sup>22</sup>.
        I was thinking of continuing on that path but then, I attended a seminar in the Philippine Society of Mechanical Engineers and learned that it will most likely take 20 years of experience before you get a 6 digit salary and that made me think a lot<sup>23</sup>.
        That will take too much time, when will I be able to give back to my parents<sup>24</sup>.
        Will I stay as a disappointment for the next 20 something years<sup>25</sup>?
        I had to shift, that is when I thought of shifting into Computer Science as well<sup>26</sup>.
        Technology is the future, and this is a bet on myself<sup>27</sup>.
        Here, there are only two things that can happen to me<sup>28</sup>.
        One is I become a failure or two, I make it big<sup>29</sup>.
        But it will be decided in a shorter period of time<sup>30</sup>.
        And I pray that I will succeed despite who I have become<sup>31</sup>.
        When I shifted to BSCS, I had the same professor for my Analysis 2, which is the equivalent of Calculus 2<sup>32</sup>.
        He told my story to the class of how I failed in his class<sup>33</sup>.
        And honestly, I was touched on what he was telling the class, I was proud<sup>34</sup>.
        I passed Analysis 2 in my first attempt with 1.75, well I did not want to disappoint him since he bragged about me already<sup>35</sup>.
        I am slowly fighting my addiction with games and everything to be a better person, and I will surely win<sup>36</sup>.
        Then my mother will think that she raised us right after all, and my father will think that everything he sacrificed was all worth it<sup>37</sup>.
        My journey is not finished and my time in BSCS is so far a lot of fun despite all the stress and challenges I am currently facing as an irregular student facing everything alone since it really is hard to maintain relationships when you're jumping from section to section<sup>38</sup>.
        But I am going to graduate, I will graduate and hopefully become a Software Engineer<sup>39</sup>.
